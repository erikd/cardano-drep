# Cardano DRep

My name is Erik de Castro Lopo and I have just registered as a Cardano DRep.

A Cardano DRep is a Delegated Representative that registers themselves to take delegation from
other people to vote in the Governance of for the Cardano network.

I have been involved with Bitcoin since about 2013, bought my first ADA in late 2017 and started
working as a Haskell developer for IOG (initially called IOHK) in February 2018. My github account
is [here](https://github.com/erikd/) and my deep involvement with the Cardano/Haskell codebase
should be obvious from that. I do not think that working for IOG is a conflict of interest because
i intend to resign from IOG in the next year or two (I am currently 61 years of age).

I feel that I am highly qualified to help with the governance of the Cardano network as I have been
deeply involved with the development of the code that runs the network. In addition to working
professionally on Cardano I have also had a keen interest in the whole cryptocurrency space since
2013.

As a Cardano DRep, I am interested in keeping race, gender, sexuality and things unrelated to the
running of the Cardano network out of the Cardano governance process. In the Open Source world, I
have seen issues unrelated to the Open Source projects have huge adverse impacts on a
[project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhttDZ99aiA) numerous times. I would like to avoid things
like this happening in the Cardano Governance system.

First and foremost I am interested in spending the ADA in the treasury system slowly, carefully and
wisely. Furthermore, I think burning even a small fraction of it would be an incredibly bad idea.

The files in this Github repo, will contain notes about Cardano in general, the DRep process,
discussion on upcoming governance questions and a record of my previous voting.
